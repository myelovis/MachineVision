ORB is basically a fusion of FAST keypoint detector and BRIEF descriptor with many modifications to enhance the performance. First it use FAST to find keypoints, then apply Harris corner measure to find top N points among them. It also use pyramid to produce multiscale-features. But one problem is that, FAST doesn't compute the orientation. 

Now for descriptors, ORB use BRIEF descriptors. But we have already seen that BRIEF performs poorly with rotation. So what ORB does is to "steer" BRIEF according to the orientation of keypoints. For any feature set of n binary tests at location (xi,yi), define a 2×n matrix, S which contains the coordinates of these pixels. Then using the orientation of patch, θ, its rotation matrix is found and rotates the S to get steered(rotated) version Sθ.
