Harris Matrix
Usually, a value in an image is of (0, 255) pixel
But, in Harris Matric, each value is a matrix

A single Pixel
For a singel pixel R = Det(M) - k((Trace))^2
with:                      M 2x2 (pixels) Matrix

Python developers ignore about the 'quality' of an variable
Different from tensorflow, numpy developers, who have to care and have a careful look on 
what type of variable to put on the program. 

In Tensorflow, first define then combine NNs
(ou define the entire computation graph (layers, operations, and connections) first and then feed the data through the graph.)
but in Pytorch, uses a dynamic computational graph, it builds and changes the graph on-the-fly as operations are executed.

Tensor is n_dimensional, in compare to matrix and vertical.


Preprocessing Vs Augmentation
Prep: 
. prepare the image to fit into a training model
. resizing, cropping, scaling pixel values between 0 and 1, normalization
Aug: 
. modify current dataset to get more versions of them, which result more noise for training
. apply random yet realistic, transformation to the input images
. help models less prone to overfitting, to have improved generalization capabilities
(the model understands the concept fron different aspects and works well in even modified 
input standards/ environments)
. horizontal and vertical flips, random rotation, color jittering, scaling (zooming), 
affine transformation, perspective transformation, erasing, gaussian blur, custom transforms 
. adjust the para maters and peobabilites for each augenmatin to ensure they introduce sufficient 
variability without distorting the underlying data distribution
