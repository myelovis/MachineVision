Harris Matrix
Usually, a value in an image is of (0, 255) pixel
But, in Harris Matric, each value is a matrix

A single Pixel
For a singel pixel R = Det(M) - k((Trace))^2
with:                      M 2x2 (pixels) Matrix

Python developers ignore about the 'quality' of an variable
Different from tensorflow, numpy developers, who have to care and have a careful look on 
what type of variable to put on the program. 

In Tensorflow, first define then combine NNs
(ou define the entire computation graph (layers, operations, and connections) first and then feed the data through the graph.)
but in Pytorch, uses a dynamic computational graph, it builds and changes the graph on-the-fly as operations are executed.

Tensor is n_dimensional, in compare to matrix and vertical.
